ASHLEY'S BABEL PROTOCOL

A typical babel datagram is composed of a header and a body.

The header must be exactly 6 bytes long and contain:
4 bytes reserved for body size
1 separator byte
1 byte for request type
The data is in binary format.
The separator byte is a full binary zero.

The body must be exactly the same size as specified in the
header, otherwise, undefined behabiour may occur.

The request types are expected to be as described here:
    (1)LOGIN
        username;password
        where username and password are strings

        server will respond with either "OK" or "KO" as ascii
